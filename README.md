# MinHashing_And_Locality_Sensitive_Hashing
Implementing the MinHashing and LSH algorithms from scratch for similarity computation between documents. We use two different datasets, which have their words indexed and their documents indexed. The dataset provides information on which documents have which words by referring to their indexes.

We test the algorithms on some examples to evaluate how good the computations are and also make some experiments concerning the time it takes to run LSH and the error between signature similarity and Jaccard similarity.
